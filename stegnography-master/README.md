# Image-Based Steganography Using Streamlit

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **web-based steganography tool** built with **Streamlit, OpenCV, and NumPy**, allowing users to **hide and retrieve secret messages** within images. The app provides a simple yet secure way to embed text inside an image without noticeable visual distortion.

## ✨ Features
- **🔒 Secure Passcode Protection** – Ensures only authorized users can decrypt messages.
- **🖼️ Image-Based Steganography** – Hides text in RGB color channels.
- **⚡ Fast & Real-Time** – Encrypts and decrypts messages instantly.
- **📂 Easy File Handling** – Upload and process images directly from the browser.
- **🚀 Lightweight & Web-Based** – Runs smoothly in a browser, no installation required.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language.
- **Streamlit** – For interactive UI.
- **NumPy** – For handling image arrays.
- **OpenCV (cv2)** – For image processing.

## 📥 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed
- Required Python libraries: `streamlit`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`
   ```

## 🎯 How to Use
### **1. Encrypt a Message:**
- Upload an image.
- Enter the secret message.
- Set a passcode.
- Encrypt and download the modified image.

### **2. Decrypt a Message:**
- Upload the encrypted image.
- Enter the message length and passcode.
- Retrieve the hidden message.
